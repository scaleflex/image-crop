       border-radius). Don't add a second mask here: this host is sized
       by JS to the full outer rect (displayW×displayH), which is 4px
       wider than the container's content-box, so its own border-radius
       wouldn't align with the container's effective inner radius
       (radius - border-width) and you'd see two stepped curves at the
       corner. Transparent bg lets the container surface show through
       in the rounded corner sliver. */
